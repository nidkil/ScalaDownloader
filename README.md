ScalaDownloader
===============

On my quest to learn Scala and Akka I am going to implement a downloader. I will build the project in a number of phases:
1) The downloader functionality, which will be single threaded.
2) Multi threaded scalable downloader functionality using Akka.
3) Add rest and json services to control the downloader.
4) Add a responsive web frontend as administration tool to the downloader.

Ones completed I should have a pretty good understanding of Scala and Akka.

I will start off with a global design and then start coding.
